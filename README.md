  Overview The Simple E-Commerce Cart Demo is a small web-based shopping cart application built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — without any external frameworks or libraries. It demonstrates how to: Display a list of products dynamically Allow users to add/remove products to/from a cart Persist the cart data using localStorage Show a real-time cart count, subtotal, tax, and total Implement a simple “checkout” interaction Technologies Used : Component Description HTML5 Provides the structure and layout of the webpage. CSS3 Used for styling the user interface and layout (grid, colors, buttons, etc.). JavaScript (ES6) Handles all interactivity: product rendering, cart management, localStorage persistence, and DOM LocalStorage Stores
Stores the cart data locally in the browser so it remains saved even after refreshing the page. Project Structure 1.HTML (Structure) Defines the main layout: header → Store name, search bar, and cart button main → Product grid and footer aside → Slide-out cart panel showing selected items Uses semantic HTML for clarity and accessibility.  2. CSS (Design & Layout). Uses CSS variables (:root) for color themes.  Implements grid layout to display products responsively.  Adds smooth animations and transitions for cart panel. Ensures the UI is responsive (works on mobile and desktop).  Key design elements: Product cards with titles, prices, and “Add” / “Buy” buttons Floating cart sidebar with quantity controls Clean, minimal modern look using neutral colors  3. JavaScript (Functionality) JavaScript provides all the dynamic behavior: a. Product Rendering renderProducts() dynamically generates the product grid. Uses a predefined product list (PRODUCTS) stored in an array of objects.  b. Search Functionality  Typing in the search bar filters products in real time by title or description.  c. Cart Management Cart data is stored as an object: { productId: quantity }  Functions: addToCart(id, qty) → Adds an item to the cart removeFromCart(id) → Removes an item setQty(id, qty) → Updates item quantity clearCart() → Clears all items The cart is saved in localStorage, so it persists between page reloads.  d. Rendering the Cart Panel renderCartPanel() builds the cart sidebar dynamically. Displays: Product name, price, and quantity controls (+ / -) Subtotal, tax (12%), and shipping fee Total and “Checkout” button e. Checkout Simulation  checkout() function shows a demo alert summarizing the order. No real payment gateway is integrated (just a simulation).  f. Cart Open/Close Controls Sidebar cart opens and closes with smooth transitions. Button states are updated for accessibility (aria-expanded, aria-hidden).
